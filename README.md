# information-security

This repository contains all of my codes I did during my Information Security course (CSE-411). 
Implementations are:
1. monoalphabetic & polyalphabetic cipher. (substitution cipher)
2. AES (ECB mode) encryption and decryption ( others )
3. RSA encryption and decryption ( others )
4. SHA-512
5. AES (CBC mode) encryption and decryption ( others )
6. AES (counter mode) encryption and decryption ( others )

** "structures.h" is the library containing implementations of [aes (ECB/CBC/CTR), rsa, sha-512]

# Language used: C++
